I was watching a tv series called The Purge, in one episode the boy & girl were having fight and it was same reason misunderstanding  but u know what she said <b>I know it's a misunderstanding and I have loose my respect in your eyes but i promise you now that i will try my best to earn my respect in your eyes because i love you so much..</b>
